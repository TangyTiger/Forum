                    Oh absoloutely! Let's just look at what he did during the 1960's. All of his non-violent protests really shows what is 
                    the most meaningful ways of protesting. He used his words and his peaceful actions instead of things
                    like burning down stores and causing chaos. In fact from <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1964/king/biographical/"><u>nobelprize.org</u></a>, " 
                    King traveled over six million miles and 
                    spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was injustice, protest, and action;" 
                    This really shows amount of peaceful work that Martin Luther King did to fight for the important rights that black people hold today.

                    Yeah I really agree with what you said there Jefferey, Martin Luther King truly was influential in the way we protest today.
                    He used something called <a href="https://medium.com/@revlmorris/what-martin-luther-king-jr-said-about-civil-disobedience-9f935f60dee6#:~:text=Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.%20considered%20civil%20disobedience%20as,wheels%20of%20justice%20would%20turn%20in%20his%20favor."><u>Civil Disobediance</u></a> 
                    to protest. Civil disobediance is the active, professed refusal of a citizen
                    to obey certian laws, demands, order, or commands of a government. MLK, for example, did sit-ins, boycotts, and marches, all 
                    of which are civil disobediance. 
                    <br>

                    Yeah Civil Obediance is really important because it helps shows the unfair laws and why, for example, equality is important. 
                    We can also look at more current situations. I love football, and recently one of my favorite players,  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/41530732#:~:text=Former%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20quarterback%20Colin%20Kaepernick%20first,a%20whole%20movement%20has%20grown%20around%20that%20gesture."><u>Colin Kaepernick</u></a> 
                    kneeled during the national anthem in protest of terrible treatment of black people. The kneeling was considered part of the Black Lives Matter
                    and Racial Justice movements. This shows the influence of Martin Luther King's protesting as he along with other very important leaders, such as Rosa Parks, 
                    used Civil Disobediance to protest for equaltiy in our nation!

                    Yeah, that Colin Kaepernick protest was really important. But not only that we see a spark in the sports world after that protest by Kaepernick. 
                    Athletes from all the different sports around the globe kneeled with Kaepernick to protest the inequality that black people are faced with 
                    every single day. So, this is what i think that Martin Luther King's legacy is on this protest - that not only was he important in how we protest,
                    like Civil Disobediance, but more importantly, he was crucial in the idea now that movements bring people together. Let's just look at his March on 
                    Washignton. That moment forever changed the course of history, and the way people protest in the coming decade because of the sheer support amongst 
                    all those at the march. About <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/march-on-washington"><u>250, 000 people</u></a>!!! Nowadays, marches 
                    and protests are about unity and coming together to fight a cause or rule, or whatever else that is causing despair to a population. Now, this relates 
                    back to the BLM and racial justice movements because now we see the importance of coming together and showing support as we saw the impact it had in the 1960's.

                    Great discussion everyone! So to summarize this thread, it comes down to a couple main points for 
                    why Martin Luther King Jr. was instrumental in the way people protest in BLM and racial justic movements today. 
                    First, we see the impact that Civil Disobediance, a key part of the the 1960 civil rights movement, and how crucial it 
                    was to ending unfair laws such as Jim Crow Laws. But more so, we find that Martin Luther King was more influential
                    in the way that movements and protests should bring unity and togetherness to fight the unjust issues in our society. 
                    That not just one of us, but many of us are necessary to ignite change in broken systems. This in fact also connects to the BLM
                    fist which represents unity. When it comes down to it, Martin Luther King was instrumental in the current movements we have today
                    because he showed the important of togetherness and unity through his marches and speeches. For all these reasons, this shows
                    how important and instrumental Martin Luther King Jr. was for the design of the current BLM and racial justice movements.
